      "Always use security gates - stop and ask user before interacting with banking, password managers, or auth screens",
      "Never skip verification step - always screenshot after action to confirm expected result",
      "Limit to 3 retry attempts - prevent infinite loops on failure",
      "Clean up screenshots - delete /tmp/pac_screen*.png after task completion",
      "User approval required for sensitive operations - implement Step 1 Plan phase with explicit confirmation",
      "Retina coordinate handling - use get-scale-factor command to get actual display scale"
